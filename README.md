# 📺 Online Streaming Event Data Analysis (Python Project)

This project analyzes **online streaming event data** to extract insights on **viewership trends, audience engagement, and technical performance** using Python.

---

## 📊 Dataset
Sample dataset containing:
- **Time** (timestamp of data capture)  
- **Viewers**  
- **Likes, Comments, Shares** (engagement metrics)  
- **Buffering Rate & Bitrate** (technical performance)  

---

## ⚙️ Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing  
   - Handled missing values  
   - Converted timestamps to datetime format for time-series analysis  

2. Data Analysis & Visualization  
   - **Viewership Trend:** Line chart showing viewers over time  
   - **Engagement Metrics:** Histograms for likes, comments, shares  
   - **Correlation Heatmap:** Shows relation between engagement & viewership  
   - **Performance Analysis:** Scatter plot of bitrate vs buffering rate  

3. Insights  
   - Peak streaming hours identified  
   - Strong correlation between engagement metrics  
   - Optimal bitrate levels found to minimize buffering

## 📈 Results
- Identified audience behavior patterns  
- Derived insights to improve stream quality  
- Provided data-driven recommendations
